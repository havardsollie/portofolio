                        <p>Overall header, navigation bar in both mobile and desktop. Image sizes in menu and watcher profile. The watcher profile got a new look.</p>

                        <h4>How I changed it</h4>
                        <p>For the nav, I found inspiration from the project exam. I found a good solution for both mobile and bigger screens. Usage of display: flex and justification of the content works well in the nav bar.
                          The image sizes was changed using a smaller aspect ratio and making them the same size using width: and height: px.
                          I did not like the design of the watcher profile so I switched it up a bit by adding a watchlist section fetching some of the movies from the API.

                        <h4>Why I did the changes</h4>
                        <p>The nav was not consistent throughout the pages, so I needed to do that. I had to fix the html as well since I put the header outside the actual header tag originally. The image sizes was all different, did not look good. The watcher profile page was to similar to the other profile page.</p>

                        <p>Found some matching colors and used them in the different pages. Fixed the nav using flex and justification. Mostly, margin was changed to 0 auto. And some padding scaled down.</p>

                        <h4>Why I did the changes</h4>
                        <p>The feedback on this assignment focused mostly on the colors. They were too many and random. I dropped some of them and am now using three. Except for the exhibitions page that has a lot of colors, but I think it is fitting on that page, as the different subjects all correspond to different colors.
                          I had to change the margin of the different sections as I put -20px on a lot of sections. This created a horizontal bar in the mobile display. And the width of some textboxes was scaled down for easy reading purposes.
